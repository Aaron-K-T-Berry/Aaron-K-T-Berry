### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aaron. I work in software engineering, mainly with NodeJs and Python applications. I'm also trying to automate related tasks using DevOps. Over the past six years, I have been working in the Australian banking and finance sector, helping teams deploy and run applications in AWS and Azure clouds.

If you want to see some of the other stuff I'm doing around the web, check out my links below:

* I do technical writing on some of the interesting problems I'm enjoying solving, and you can read about them [here](); I am also available for work, so feel free to [reach out]().  
* If you have interesting software projects, ideas or opportunities, contact me via [Email](mailto:aaron.berry@ab-consulting.dev) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-kt-berry/) to discuss them.
* If you are in the homelab or home server gear market, consider checking out [Server Labs Aus.](https://serverlabs.com.au/) for your next purchase.
